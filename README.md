This repository contains the projects related to Statistical Analysis.

 - FDA.rmd contains Functional Data Analysis, and digs into the  relation between the carbon production and the cost of electricity. This is a project IÂ´ve done the
   4th year of University.
 - Trabajo_Supervivencia.rmd is a Survival Analysis, containing data from people with the flu and how it affects their situation at the hospital. Survival probability,
   whether it affects differently women or men, how the age factors in... This is also a 4th-year project.
 - Practica_1_Simulacion is a project on Simulation Techniques, such as the inverse sampling method and the rejection sampling. This is a 4th year project. 
 - RLM-trabajo.R and Trabajo_RLog.R are both projects containing regression analysis, linear in the first case and then Logistic. Both of these are from my second year.
 - TraballoMEDAD.R contains a project about Statistical Modelling with High-Dimensional Data. This is a 2nd-year project.
